# Instructions
`*.whl` files are managed by `git-lfs`([Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/)).
If you want to download those files by "cloning",
for Windows, follow the [official instruction](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to install `git-lfs` first.

For Linux, install `git-lfs` with
```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git-lfs
git lfs install
```
